        Yakan refers to the majority Muslim group in Basilan, an island province just south of Zamboanga peninsula. “Basilan” may mean “the waterway into the sea” or may derive from the Yakan word for “the way to the iron” because of the presence of minerals in the island. It measures 1,358 sq km, the largest in the Sulu archipelago. Located at the northern end of the Sulu archipelago, it is bounded in the north by Zamboanga City; in the south by the Sulu archipelago, with Jolo as the major island; in the east by Mindanao; and in the west by the Sulu Sea and Sabah (North Borneo). Basilan enjoys good weather because it is located below the typhoon belt. Abundant rainfall throughout the year keeps the soil wet and fertile.
