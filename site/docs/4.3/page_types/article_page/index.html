                Yakan refers to the majority Muslim group in Basilan, an island province just south of Zamboanga peninsula. “Basilan” may mean “the waterway into the sea” or may derive from the Yakan word for “the way to the iron” because of the presence of minerals in the island. It measures 1,358 sq km, the largest in the Sulu archipelago. Located at the northern end of the Sulu archipelago, it is bounded in the north by Zamboanga City; in the south by the Sulu archipelago, with Jolo as the major island; in the east by Mindanao; and in the west by the Sulu Sea and Sabah (North Borneo). Basilan enjoys good weather because it is located below the typhoon belt. Abundant rainfall throughout the year keeps the soil wet and fertile.

                Basilan’s nearness to Borneo has led to the theory that the Yakan originated from the Dyak, but certainly Basilan’s history is related to that of the Sulu archipelago. The Sultanate of Sulu became a center of power in the 1700s after defeating the Sultanate of Maguindanao. Its seat of power was Jolo, and it ruled over the island of Basilan although nominally, having little influence over the Yakan because they lived in the interior. The Yakan, though, paid a yearly tribute to the sultan.

                At large gatherings, the Yakan entertain each other with untukan (riddles). The subjects of the riddle derive from their natural surroundings, such as in the following (Behrens 2007, 213, 216):

                The most prominent example of Yakan literature is the origin myth or legend. Two related origin myths narrate the story of the world and of mankind. First, there was only darkness until God created light, and then water, which the wind scattered all over. Then God created the trees, which bore 7.7 million fruits. Next, he created a bird, which died after eating the last fruit. After the bird’s death, God created 70 Adams, one after another, each with a life span of 70 years. The last Adam is supposedly the ancestor of the people.
